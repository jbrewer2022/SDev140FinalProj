User Manual for Login Program

Introduction:

The Login Program is a simple GUI application built using Python's tkinter library.
The purpose of this program is to provide a secure login system with the ability to set and update user credentials. 
The program consists of two windows, the Login window, and the Main window.

Login Window:

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with the Login window.
Here, you need to enter your username and password to log in. 
If you are a first-time user or have not set any credentials yet, you can use the default username "user123" and password "password" for demonstration purposes.

Logging In:

To log in, enter your username and password in the respective fields. 
If either field is left empty, the program will prompt you to fill in both fields before proceeding. 
Click the "Login" button to verify your credentials. 
If the provided username and password match the saved credentials, the program will transition to the Main window. 
Otherwise, an error message will be displayed, indicating that the login details are invalid.

Main Window:

The Main window is accessible only after successful login. 
In this window, you will find some basic information displayed along with the program's logo or main image.

Setting New Credentials:

If you wish to change your login credentials, you can do so within the Main window. 
Enter your desired new username and password in the respective fields provided. 
Note that both fields must be filled before updating your credentials. 
Click the "Set New Credentials" button to save your changes. 
Upon success, a message will appear, confirming that your credentials have been updated.

Exiting the Program:

To exit the program, click the "Exit" button in the Login window. 
A confirmation prompt will appear, asking if you are sure you want to exit. 
Choose "Yes" to close the application or "No" to return to the Login window.

Note:

For the purpose of this demonstration, the program uses default login credentials. 
In a real-world application, it is essential to have secure authentication mechanisms.
The program allows users to set new credentials in the Main window for illustration purposes. 
In practice, this feature should be reserved for administrators or privileged users.

Conclusion:
The Login Program is a basic and user-friendly application that provides a secure login system. 
It allows users to log in with their credentials, update their login details. 
Enjoy using the program and feel free to provide feedback for further improvements!
